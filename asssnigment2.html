        Molly had been starting out of her<b> window</b> for about an hour now.<q> Onher desk</q>, lying between the copies of <i><b> narture,New Scientist</b></i>,and all
         the order<br> scintific joumals her work had appeared in,was a well thumbed copy of <i> On the Road</i>.
         It had been mollly's favourite book sicen college,and the longer she</br> spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        <p>
        she had spent the last ten year in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscer Wilde quote proclaiming that"work is the refuege of people 
        who have<br> nothing better to do".Although many considered her pioneering work,unravelin the secretes of the DNA,to be an outstanding achievement
        ,molly</br> did think she had something better do.
